ΝΟΤΙΟΕ.’

ΗΕ Editor begs to express his regret at the delay ex-

perienced in the publication of the present volume, but
circumstances over which he had no control retarded its progress
through the press. Several important documents, extending
over a considerable period in the history of the Island, became
mislaid, and necessitated their being replaced. The delay arising
from this cause, combined with severe family illness, has retarded
the work till now. The Editor trusts, however, that the Third
Volume will be found of equal interest with its predecessore.
Had time permitted it was his intention to have added a List of
References to the various MSS. made use of throughout the
work. Such a list he has nearly ready for the press 3 and at
some future period it——together with several additional docu-

ments recently obtained-may appear as an Addendum to the

“ Monumenta3’
