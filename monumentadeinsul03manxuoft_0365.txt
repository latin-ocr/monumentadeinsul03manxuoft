publication will also embrace any original papers with which the Council may be
favoured, illustrative of the objects the Society has in view. The Rev. Thos. E.
Brown, M.A., late Viee-Principal of King William's college, Isle of Man, and now
Head Master of the Crypt Grammar school, Gloucester‚ has, on being solicited‚
consented to edit this or a subsequent Misc llany embracing national songs,

Ι proverbe, legende, δια, in reference to which the Council (leem it highly essential

that immediate arrangements should be made for the collection and publication as
regards interesting matters connected with the Island ; and that the same should
be referred to a subcommittoe of the Counoil, consisting of the two Honorary
Seeretaries with two or more Members of the Society who would take an interest
therein, to determine what may be really worthy of publication. and to arrange
the doeuments with notes &03 and that the same Committee may be authorised
to examine the Public Records, Parish Registers‚ and ot -er pay· rs of importance,
and to put themselves in communication with parties likely to possess anything of
an interesting nature. To carry out this, with a view to satisfactory results, the
Council emphatically urge the members to unite in making applicatio ι in evei-y
suitable quarter for papers‚ letters, and documents which may fall within the plan
of such a work ; and hope that every member and other friends of the society who
may possess such manuscripts will not hesitate to allow their being 115811 for such
a purpose, and not to under-rate the value and interest of what may at first sight
appear only trivial and common-place, and therefrom—-not from any want of
liberal tun-but from misconeeption as to their suitableness for publication—keep
back the communications they may possess. By these means it is hoped valuable
and interesting matter connected with our Island home may be rescued from
obhvion, and form a work such as it is 1118 peculiar province of societies like the
present to orig nate and promote. All communicatione they are favoured with
will be duly acknowledged in the volume-s in which they are published.

In the previous annual report it will be observecl that an offer had been
made by the London philologieal Society to print Dr. Kelly’s Triglott Dictionary,
consisting of the Irish, Erse, and Manx, provided that on examination it should
be considered worthy of the expense. A few manuscript sheets were submitted
to the Couneil of that Society, but their report was unfavourable, as upon close
examination it became manifest that the three divisions of the work stood in
three very different gradations of value. The Manx portion was doubtless very
important as representing many words of which not a trace remains in any other
specimen of the language which has hitherto been made available to the public 3
but the Irish and Erse portions stand in a very different position, for as Dr.
Kelly died in 1809, they can only represent the lexicography of those languages
prior to that date. The Council conclude their report by stating that “it is their
opinion that although there is in the work much which in a literary and antiqua-
rien point of view, would be interesting. its philologioal value (in the strict 581158

of that word) would not justify them in expending the resources of the Society in
its publication.”
