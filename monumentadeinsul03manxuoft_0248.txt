De Testamenlis condendis.

Praecipimus et statuimus quod qui-
libet languens in extremis agoniisl cum
testamentum condere voluerit vocet
capellanum ecclesiae et clericum, et ipsis
praesentibus, duobus vel tribus viris
adhibitis bonis et fide dignis, testamen-
tum suum oro suo ordinet, et ipse
sacerdos substantiam suam diligenter
exquiret, et si in aliquibus, creditoribus
sit obnoxius vel de aere alieno oneratus
Quod si non fecerit tanquam intestatus
reputatur. Quod statutum volumus ut
singuli capellani iu ecclesiis suis publi-
cent. Item statuimus, ut quicunque
amodo se creditorum alicujus dixerit
defuncti, vel aliquem cum eo iniisse
contractum, et in eadem parochia ma-
nens, vel ita prope quod de infirmitate
ejus constare poterit, non in vita sua,
nec hora testamenti. vel tempore infir-
mitatis illius, super hoc questionem
moverit, vel mentionem fecerit coram
viris fide dignis, post mortem defuncti
nullatenus audiantur.

 

APPENDIX.

something on the part of the prince, we
enjoin and allow the same, not during
the solemnization of the mass, but
either before or after, when it can be
most conveniently done, yet outside the
church, lest the celebration of divine
service be interfered with„

Of the malciny of Wills.

We ordain and decree that when
any person sick nuto death desire
to make a will, he call to him the
chaplaiu and clerk of his church‚
and in their presence, two or three
trustworthy men, and of good repnte,
being associated with them, dictate his
will of his own mouth, and the priest
is himself to examine diligently into
his substance, and whether in any
respect he be obnoxious to creditors or
burthened with debt. Which if it be
not done let him be held as having died
intestato. Which ordinance we desire
all cha} lains to publish in their several
churches. Also we do ordain that
whosoever shall henceforth declaro
himself a creditor of any deceased per·
son, or say that he had entered into
any engagement with him, and, dwel-
ling in the same parish, or so near that
he could be apprised of his filnes-²1, did.
not move the question of this matter
either in his life-time or at the time of
his testamentary arrangements, or at
the time of his illness, or mention the
same before trustworthy persons, shall
by no means receive a hearing after
the death of the deceased.
