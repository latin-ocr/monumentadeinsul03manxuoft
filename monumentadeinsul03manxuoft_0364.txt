vieiv, but useful praetio-any, have assumed a. length not at first calculated upon, and
have necessarily encroachr d upon the vaiuable time ot the learned editor. It is
hoped that the legal profession especially will highly appreciate the publication of
this authoritativo Manx document. One volume of this work, together with
‘⁴ Chalomr's Tra-*ti ‚’' subsequently alluded to, and the third volume of tho
“Monumenta,²’ will form the delivery for the fourth year.

In their last report the Council stated that considerable progress had been
made in the arrangements for bringing out the Maux and English Dictionary of
the iate Rev. Dr. Kelly. They are now iu a position to state that such arrange-
ments have been completed. Ῥω chief portion is already printed, under the able
editorship of the Rev. Wm. Gill, vicar of Malew‚ and the Rev. J. T. Clarke, chap-
lain of St. Mark's, in the same parish; two gentlemen well fitted to overcome the
difficulties they have to contend with, and to complete the arduous labour of love
they have so ›xindly undertaken. The'latter gentleinan has, in accordance with
the wishes of the Council, adopted the first column of Dr. Keliy's Triglott as the
basis of the English-Manx¹pa1·t of the Dictionary. By this means a valable por-
tion of the Doctor's larger work will be rescued from oblivion,and the Dictionary
in both its parts will appear under the sanction of the Doctor's name, whilst Mr-
Mosley’s manuscript will be taken advantage of and duly employed in the process.

“The Life and Times of william Christian, otherwise Illiam thne‚'' looked
for with much interest by the members as one of the publications sor the current
year, has also been greatly retarded by the removal of ΜΓ. Burman from Castic-
town, and the consequent inconvenience of not having ready access to the insular
records there deposited. These will form the delivery sor the past year. The
other works in progress and in contemplation are—First‚ “ A Short Treatise on
the Isle of Man,'' (before alluded to) published in 1656, by Governor Chaloner
‘⁶ illustrated with several prospects of the Island by Daniel King.⁷’ The work is
dedicated to Lord Fairfax in 1653, who held the Lordship of Man eight years
under the Cotnmonwea th, and whose pertrait from a painting by lValker, will be
given together with biographical notices of his Lordship'and his Lieutenant-
Govern n* Sec. This work is very scarce, and has never, wo believe, been pub-
lished by itself, but as forming a portion of “ King's Vale Royal,'’ &c., will be
edited by the Rev. J. G. Cumming, M.A., F.G.S., a portion of whose notes,
together with others thereon, have been laid before the Counci13 and from the
well<knowu literar-y reputation of the Editor, who resided in this Island for many
years iu capacity of Vice-Principal to the College‚ aud from his several contribu·

publicatione. The illustratione in the original work will bc reproduced by the
recently-discovered process οἱ Photo-lithography, to be executed by Mr. G. A.
Dean. A volume of Miscellanies as stated in the last report is also under con-

of the society, and under the superintendence of a competent Editor, may be
