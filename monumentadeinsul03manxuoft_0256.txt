by the bishop. But the chnreh and
all its ornaments as well in books as
vestments and other needful things
must be kept clean and decent by the
vicar of the ehurch at his own expense,
together with the baptismal font, the

Which vicar indeed must render an

ordinaries† of all things which are

‡ The festival of the Purifieation of the Blessed Virgin Mai-y is celebrated in a particu-
lar manner, with a procession of lighted candles. Immediately after the procession mass
'is celebrated, the congregation holding the burning candles meanwhile in their hands.
Hence thc old English name Candle Mass Day. These candles are commonly left to the
chureh, and gifts of more candles are offered for the use of the altar. Pope Gelasius Ι.
