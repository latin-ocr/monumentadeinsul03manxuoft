SYNODAL ORDINANCES OF BISHOP RUSSELL.

A.D. 1350.

Hae sunt additiones, additae per vene-
rabilem patrem dominum Willielmum
Russell, Sodorensem episcopum una
cum toto clero Manniae, anno Domini
millesimo tricentesimo quinquagesimo,
in ecclesia sancti Michaelis Archangeli,
septimo kalendas Martii.

Ad pastorale spectat officium circa
statum ecclesiarum et animarum salu-
tem pastori provido commissarum cu-
ram impendere pervigilem, ut de grege
sibi commisso rationem redditurus, de
talento sibi credito lucrum reportare
valeat indeficiens. Id est quod ex his
quae ab antiquis patribus prins statuta
sunt, quaedam ad praesens ad memoriam
revocamuS, pauca de novo ad haec adji-
cientes, ne regimen commissum sub
dissimulatione (quod absit) negligere
videamus. Cum regimen animarum sit
ars artium et sancta et salubris est
operatio pro defunctis exorare: impri-
mis, deliberato cleri nostri consilio,
duximus statuendum etquocienscnnque
aliquis rector, vicarius, vel capellanus,

honesta persona, orationum nostrarum
suffragiis commendata et ad similia
suffragia commendata et nobis obligata

locum et diem sepulturae ejus, omnes
alii superstites absque quocunque fig-
mento vel colore‚conveniant et def uncto

These are the additions made by the
venerable father Lord William Russell’

we may not seem by dissembling (which
be it far from us) to neglect the rule
committed to us. Since the government
of souls is the art of arte, aud to pray

clergy in the first place, we have
caused it to be ordained that as often
as any rector, vicar, or chaplain of our
church of Man, or an)r other honourable
person commended to the intercession
of our prayers, and engaged and bound
to us for a like assistance, shall haply
depart this life, at the place and on the
day of his interment all who survive
him, without any pretence or excuse
should assemble together and pay
