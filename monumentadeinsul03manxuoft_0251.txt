Natalinm Domini, et in obsequiis mor-
tuorum videlicet, cum corpus alicujus
defuncti eo die fuerit in ecelesia tumu-
landum. Et hoc siin diebus Dominicis
et festivis contigerit, tunc caveat sacer-
dos cum ipse recinerat manus suas et
calicem cum aqua et vino post commu-
nionem, ne sumat ablutionem, sed re-
ponat illam in vaso mundo usque ad
finem alterius missae, et tunc sumat
utramque ablutionem, quia propter
reverentiam sacramenti non debet ali-
quis celebrare nisi jejunus. Si ablu·
tionem illam sumpsisset quae est pura
aqua. vel purum vinum, tunc jejunus,
non esset. Item districtius inhibemus,
ne aliquis sacerdos duabus matricibus
ecclesiis deservire praesumat; et pro-
videat sacerdos quod ab inchoatione
missae usque ad finem, lucerna cerea
ardeat.

Expliciunt statuta synodalia.

Easter excepted, and of Christmas‚ and
in cases of the obsequies of the dead
to wit, on the day when the corpse of
any deceased shall be interred in the
chnrch. And it this should happen on
Lord’s days or festivals, then let the
priest be carefuL until he have himself
washed his hands and the chalice with
water and wine after communion, not
to drink the ablution, but let him keep
it in a pure vessel until the conclusion
of the second mass, and then let him
receive both ablutione, because none
unless he be tasting ought out of a
due reverence to the sacrament to
celebrate it, and if he took the ablu-
tion, which is pure wine and water,
then he would not be fasting.* Also
we do forbid most strictly any priest
from presuming to officiate in two
mother churches ;† ancl the priest is to
take care that from the commencement
of the mass until the end a waxen taper
be kept burning.

The synodal statutes are endedssj

*ἒ In tlte Catholic church no one except the dying is allowed to receive the Holy Com-
munion, who is not strictly fasting, without swallowing drop or crnmb since midnight.
One part os the mass is the communion of the priest. What he receives in the commu-
nion is, according to the teaching of that clim-ch, the precious body and blood of Our
Lord, which therefore not being any natural food or drink does not render him incapable
of receiving again in a second mass. The case⁸is different with the wine and water, in
which he washes the tips of his fingers and rinses out the chalice after communion, and
which are called from that “ the ablution” or “ ablutions.'' These never being conse·
crated remain simple natural wine and water to the last. Of which the priest partaking
would therefore break his fast the same as if he should drink any other wine and water,
and consequently render himself unfit by the laws of his chutch to celebrate asecond
mass after it.

† In a parish or town where there are several churches, the principal chun-oh, and espe-
cially the pai-ish church, sex-ved by the parson of the parish or his substitute, is
called the ‘⁸ mother church,” and all the minor churches and dependent cbapels of ease,
served by vicars and chaplains, are called the “ daughter churehes.”
