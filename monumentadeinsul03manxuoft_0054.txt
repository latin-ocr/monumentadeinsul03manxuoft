†Thomas, second Earl of Derby died 1521. WVolsey was created Legata by Pope
Adrian VL, 1522, consequently the date of this letter must have been subsequent to that
event, and prior to Nov. 29th‚ 1530, when Wolsey died. Edward, third Earl of Derby,
for whom the cardinal desired the stewardship of F urness was a minor till 1531, and was
one of that magnificent prelate's rabit-sue, having five domestic attendants allowed him.
