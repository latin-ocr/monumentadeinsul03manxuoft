MONUMENTA DE INSULA MANNIAE. 171

All Freeholds were originally Feuds, and held of some Μ31101·,
311(1 they were for the most pars enfranchised with the reservation
of a Heriot, or 3 Quit rent, or both. In some Grants the quit reni:
was pecuniary (3 few shillings only), in others 3 pepper corn, or
3 red rose; and 311 1311050 acknowledgementS, however trifiing‚
oblige ‘che Freehoffler, to this day, ‘co pay 511113 and service ab tho
Baron Court, and do Fealty ; bur, where no reservation is made
no Fealby can be due.

The jurisdiction which the crown now 1135 over this Island can
in 110 501150 comprehend feudal services, which appertain solely ‘co
the Tenure, and are due from the Tenants and lesser Barons ‘co the
chief Lord3 and ib must be observed 131131] in ‘che vesting act, the
Duke reserves 311 kinds off suits and services 35 appendages to his
Barony. .

We are therefore of Opinion thar the Memorialish cannot wi‘eh
any propriety tendet his Feal‘cy, 313 the Tinwald Cour'c, to 1110
King, by virbue of his property in ‘che Barony of S‘o. Trinions 3
and ‘chat the same, if (1110, 0311 only be made 150 the Duke of Athol
ah his Baron Courb. From him 'che Gran'n was, and to his
Gracc alone this kind of service can redound.
