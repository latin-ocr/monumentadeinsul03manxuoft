Let the host to be given to the sick
be renewed upon each Lord’s day, and
let it be set in an honourable place, to
wit, in a pyx appointed for this purpose
covered with a. corporalf'* and let it
never be laid by without a corporal
covering. But it may be renewed upon
other days in case of necessity. And
inasmuch as several hosts are eonse-
erated at once, the celebrant must
direct his intention to them all, and
not to one only. And on the priests
themselves we strongly urge never to
dare to consecrate to their own damna-
tion, whenever they feel themselves

involved in any mortal sin.

Moreover we have ordained that
parish churches and their eemeteriae,
according to the means of the parish-
ioners, should by the parishioners them·
selves, and the chancels by the rectors,
be decently constructed in all needful
particulars 3 and that the altars must be
properly furnished with ornaments,

against the abusos of the Syrian J acobite and N estorians, who have been accustomed to
mix a little salt and oil in the host ever since the sixth century as they assert.—Mi9ne‚ c.
t. 23, 89, and 20, 244. The host is stamped with figures of the passion and resurrection
of Our Lord, or the imprint of his holy name. A primitive practice retained in the
Eastern communion as well as in the Latin chu1·ch.—-Mz[qne, e. t. 23, 900.

¹* Corporal is the piece of linen spread under the consecrated host, “ Corpus Domini?
during the mass Hence its name. The same name was given to the veil thrown over
the chalice. At first this veil was also of linen‚ but about the seventh century it began to
be made of silk and adorned with gold and jewels. Out of the mass the same marks of
respect were continued to the sacred host reserved in the pyx, setting the pyx on a corpo-
ral, and covering it with a veil.—Miqne c. t. 20, 234, and 359.

candles of wax in the clim-ch dates from the beginning. In particular during celebration
of mass two or more lamps or candles were kept burning at the altar, and in front of
the place where the consecrated Host was reserved a lamp was kept perpetually burning.
