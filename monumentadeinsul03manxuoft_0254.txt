APPENDIX.

’ siastical offices should, firmly and with-

out ceasing, expound to their people
the word of God and the catholic and
apostolic faith upon all Lord's days and
festivals, and should diligently instruct
those subjected to them in the articles
of the saith, and should teach and
instruct them to understand the apos-
tle's creed in their mother tongue, and
should expound the same saith to their
children and teach them the articles.
We have also ordered that the holy
rites of the chureh be celebrated
with devout reverence, under the set
forms delivered to us in writing by the
holy fathers, which forms, approved by
the catholic saith, let none dare to

into vinegar it is changing all the
substantial strength of the wine is lost,
and water may be added in so moderate

absorbed by the water but [rather] the
water by the wine. The host should
be made of wheat, round and whole,

admixturc. It must be marked with a
stamped impression It must not be boiled
in water, but buked with fixe*

²¹² The Latin chureh has consecrated in unleavened bread from very remote antiquity3
while the different communions of the East use leavened. But consecration is valid in
both. Theologians and rubricists require the host to be made of simple wheaten flour and
water. Admixture of any other substance, for instance, oatmeal, barley flour, milk, oil,
oggs‚ butter, sugar, &c.‚ would render the matter doubtful. In particular this caution is
