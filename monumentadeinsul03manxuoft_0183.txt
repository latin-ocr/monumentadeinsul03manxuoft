FOEDERA.

PAT. 9, ΈΞΑΥ it please your mosb excellenfi Majes‘cy, Accord-
CAR. I. j ing· ‘co your pleasure signified by Master Seeretary

Coke, We have taken considerabion of the question oonoerning·
the Donabion of the Bishopriek of Man, and find that in the
time of King· Henry 4 the Patronage of ‘chat Bishopriok was
graunted ‘co one of the Progeni‘cors of the Earl of Derby from
‘chata time untill ‘che twen‘uy-fifth year of King Henry 8, when
the manner of conferring of Bishoprieks within the King's
Dominions was directed, VVee find no Congedeslier nor Con-
firma‘cion nor Restitu‘cion of Temporalities by bhe King, but how
thar Bishopriek was in that time conferred hath nob appeared
unto Us by any Record or other thing, which Wee ean say is
authentique. After the Statute of 25 H. S. that} is 37 Η. 8.
His Majesty conferred than Bishopric‚ but it was a Donation no‘s,
by Congedeslier as is directed by the Statum, which mig-hb be
by a ‘citle fallen during ‘the VVardship of the Earl of Derby, who
came to full age about the time when there was difference
between the Bishop of Rome and the King, and the Patent)
recites thais it had been long void.

After ‘chat in ‘che twelvth year of ‘che late Queen Elizabeth,
the Bishopriek being· void, ‘che then Earl of Derby, by an Instru-
menb under his Hand and Seal, commanded and nominated one
‘co the Bishoprick, humbly praying her Majes‘cy to write ‘co the
Arehbishop of York ‘co consecrate and install him, which was
done accordingly.
