CHARTER OF ΕΟΒΕΞΤΒ.ιε

John,by the grace of God, King of England, διο. Know ye, that for the honor
of God and the health of our soul, and the souls of our ancestors and successors,
and for the exaltation of Holy Chureh, and for the reformation of our kingdom,
we have, of our free and good will, given and granted, for us and our heirs, these
libet-ties hereafter specified, to be and observed in our kingdom of England for

ever.

Ι. Imprimis, All the forests made by our grandfather, King Henry, shall be
viewed by honest aud lawfnl men; and if he turned any other than his own proper
woods into forests, to the damage οἱ him whose wood it was, it shall forthwith be
laid out again and disafforested. And if he turned his own woods into forestS,
they shall remain SO, saving the common of pasture to such as were formerly
wont to have.

ΙΙ. These men who dwell without the forest, from heneeforth shall not come
before our justiciaries of the forest, upon common summoue, but such as are
impleaded οι· the pledges of any, for any that were attached for something con-
cerning the forests.

III. All woods that have been taken into the sorests in our own time shall
forthwith be laid out again; ancl the like shall be done with the rivers that
have been taken or fenced in by us during our reign.

IV. The arehbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barone, knights, and free tenants
who have woods in any forests, shall have their woncls as they had them at the
time of the first eoronation of our grandfather, King Hem-y, so as they shall be
diseharged for ever of all purprestures‚† wasme, and assarts,‡ made in those
woods‚ after that time, to the beginning of the second year of our coronatiom and
those who for the time to come shall make waste, purpresture, or assart in those
woods, without our lieenee, shall answer for them.

V. Onr inspectore or viewers shall go through the foresta to make a view, as it
was wont to be at the time of. the first coronation of our said grandfather, King
Henry, and not otherwise.

ᾗ As the foi-ests, commonS, or wastes of the Island are at the present time undet-going
the process of disafforestafion, the editor has printed the following charter, as being
the only document extant bearing upon the subject of roy-al forests. The Forests
belonged originally to the Crown, and the Kings had at different perioda granted
parts and parcels οἲ them to private individuals, who had grubhed them up. and
made them arable and pasture; but yet all those parts retained tho name of forest.
These foi-ests belonging to the King as his own demesneS, or as the sovereign lox-d, were
a continual source of vexatious suits, as well against those who held them of the King,
as against the neighbouring freemen‚ under pretence of the rights of the crown. There
is no original of this chartei· extant, nor any copy older than the first of Henry ΙΙΙ,
