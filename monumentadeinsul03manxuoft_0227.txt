or JOHN QUAYLE, Esq„ PROPRIETOR or THE BARONY or ST.
TRINioxs, CLAIMING THE Pmmmsss THEREUNTO BELONGING.

S the lWemorialist claims certain ancient privileges here-
before belonging to the Barony of St. Trinions, and
deduces them from a very early period, it will be necessary to
have recourse to some kind of historica] research to investigate
this claim.

We find that after the Conquest, the lands of England were
granted by the Conqueror to distinguished persons who had
served him in arms, reserving at the same time Honorary service
to the crown. These tracts of ground which were very large
were called Baronies, srom whence their owners got the title of
Barons, and became lords of Parliament. These Barons not
being able to occupy whole counties, subdivided their lands and
created lesser Baronies under them, reserving to themselves,
however, pecunia-ry and other services. These lesser Barons in
time created Barons under them, till at length the original
Baron who was the chief lord of the fee, found his power and
services diminished by these multiplied sub-creationS. To remedy
this, it was provided by statute of westminster, 3⁶ and 18,
Ed. I. “That upon all sales or feoffments of lands, the feoffee
should hold the same not of his immediate feoffer, but of the
chief lord of the Fee of whom such feoffer himself hold it.’'
