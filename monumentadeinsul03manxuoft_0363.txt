THE FIFTH REPORT

01³· THE

COUNCIL OF THE MANX SOCIETY,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING MAY 1, 1863.

ΙΤ is with sincere ‘regret that the Couneil, in presenting their Fifth Report for the

Lieutffeovemor, has been pleased to accept the vacant office and to become a
member of the society.

With reference to the first publication promised for the past year, viz„ Dr.

This collection of documents, when complete, will, they trust, prove a valuable
assistance to the future historian of the Island (the real history of which has yet
to be written) and as a work of reference they venture to hope that the last
volume will be found not less acceptable than the preceding ones edited by the
same gentleman. The second work, “Part-’s Abstract,’' edited by James Gen,
Esq., H.B. of Casthtown, which the last Report would lead members to anticipare,
has also been delayed. With the voluminous notes appended thereto, it will form

“ two or more volumes—the first of which is in the hands of the printer, and is ex-

pected shortly to be issued. The notes, which are not only valuable in a literary
