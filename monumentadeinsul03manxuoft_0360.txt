Third—Bibliotheca Monensis: a Bibliographical Account of Works relating·
to the Isle of Man. By William Harrison, Esq., HK.

The first of these volumes, “ Feltham’s Tour,” a w01k now seldom met with,
is well deserving the attention of the public, not only from its comparative
scarcity‚ but also from the extreme accuracy of the information contained in its
pages ; and is valuable as giving an insight into the conditlon of the Ieland at
a period when our historiens were few and facilities for investigation exceedingly
scanty.

Of the important documents contained in Dr. Oliver’s volume& and which
have appeared mostly for the first time, the Council cannot but express their
conviction that they will be most highly appreciated.

The third and last work issued to the Membem, the “ Bibliotheca Monensis‚'’
will be found to be an important addition to our Island literature ; and highly to
be prized as aflording to future historians a ready means of reference to works
but little known to exist.

The Council have to state that an offer has been made by the Philological
society of London to print Dr. Kelly’s Triglott Dictionary and supply it to our
own members at eost price, provided on examination it should be considered
worthy of the expense of publication 3 and with this object in view several
manuscript sheets have been placed in possession of the Council of that Society.

The works in piogress for the past and. ensuing year are the “ Monumenta,”
Vol. ΙΙΙ. ; “The Life and Times of william Christian ;’' and “ Pari-’s Abstract?
A volume of Miscellanies is also under the consideration of the Council, and will
probably form one of the early issues.

The Council cannot conclude this their fourth report without again urging
upon those Members and friends of this Society having documenta in their pos-

session worthy of publication to place them at the disposal of the Council for this
purpose.

Read and adopted at the Annual General Meeting.

SENHOUSE WILSON, CHAIRMAN.
