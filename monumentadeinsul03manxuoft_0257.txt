an Easter candle of wax,’¹‘ which we
would by no means have wanting in any
church of our diocese for that purpose
upon festal days. And if that be not
sufficient for this purpose, let the rector
provide it, as is set forth in the statutes
of our predecessors. We have also or-
dained that no church or oratory shall
be built in our diocese without our con-
sent, and that in any so built without
our authority the divine rites (mass) be
not by any temerity celebrated, or
rather according to the canons profaned.

Also [we have ordained] that every
rector of a parish church should have
near him a mansion decently construct-
ed in which the bishop, archdeacon,
and their ordinaries can be received and
entertained. And especially in the
cases of churches appropriated to houses
exempted from the jurdisdiction of the
ordinaries,† this must be done within
a year from the day of the publication
of these presents, the effpense of the

places ext-ra standing candles also are lighted and kept burning during the same time.
They are called elevatiou candles. This practice is not older than the twelfth century.—

³⁶ The Paschal candle is a large candle blessed with much ceremony on Holy Saturday,
and burned during paschal time, i.e., from Holy Saturday till Ascension Day. It was in
use in the time of Pope Zosimus, an. 417, but is probably much omen—Mimas Beryier.

† Monastefies, otherwise called Religious Houses and Regular Houses, were by a

privilege of canon law withdrawnwr exempted from the jurisdiction os the bishop and

his ordinaries, and placed under inspection of superiors of their own. Hence another

name for them, Exempt Houses.

The revenues of a parish were sometimes made over

for the maintenance of a monastery, seminary, hospital, cathedral‚ the bishop, &c.. In

canon law this was called appropriation.
