170 MONUMENTA DE INSULA MANNIAE.

The Barony of St, Trinions, was one of 111656 165561· Barons,
held of 1116 Prior of Whithorn in Galloway, who held 11 of 1116
chief lord. It appears by 1116 Ρ61311101161·’5 memorial that 11115
Barony was either forfeited or escheated 10 1116 101·(1, and of
course all services ceased. Ab what period 11115 happened, does
1101 appear, bul] 11 would be strange 10 imagine ‘chat 1116 chief
lord, aster a lapse of several 0601111165, could now revive these
services, which have nothing 10 countenance 1116111 111113 imme-
morial usuage, whilsb 1116 Common Law says—“ that aiz 11115 111116
of day none of 111656 feuda] tenures which are badges of slavery ’
can be created anew.’'

If a copyhold be forfeited 10 1116 lord, he cannob make a fresh
gran‘n of 11 as a copyhold, for 1116 very forfeiture is an eufran*
chisement.

From 1116 memorial 11 15 clear 111111 1116 fealby was always made
10 1116 Lord proprietor, that 15 10 say, 1116 chief Lord of 1116 Fee,
who held immediately under 1116 crown, as Sir John Stanley did,
and as 1116 Duke of Athol now (1065. Τ116 case of Mr. Sherbmne,
who produced a Grani] from Chas. Π. os 1110 Barony of Bangor
(which 11 15 assumed mighss have been forfeited 10 1116 crown for
Treason, or have been seized ab 1116 Reformation), and made
Fealssy 10 1116 Earl of Derby, 1116 lord propi-letor. Had we seen
11115 grant, we should have understood 11 bethem but even sup-
posing 11 should be objected‚ that Mr. Sherburne did Fealty 10
Lord Derby, as 1116 Sovereign Lord of 11115 Island, there was
nothing· very improper in 11, as his grant was from 1116 King,
and his lands were under 13116 peculial* Sovereign‘cy of Lord Derby.

There can be no objection 10 1116 11116 of 1116 memorialisb 10
1116 Barony, thah is 10 say, 10 1116 Β61115, Ρ1·01115, Services, and
Emoluments belonging 10 11, which are all thass appears 130 be
conveyed. No reservation of Services seems 10 have been made
by 1116 Duke as superior Lord, and 1116 Services conveyed, are
such as 1116 Baron's Tenants, owe 10 1116 immediate proprietor of
1116 Barony, and in 11115 case 1116 memorialist has an entire free-

hold, and owes no Feal‘oy 10 any body.
