800311,- and what] more enoreases our misfortunes, three of the
hopefullesfi of our young men, that ever ‘ohe island bred, have
deserted us, for fear they should be imposed on them. I know I
need no other argument to so grean a patron of the ehureh tha-n
‘co open the misery of our condition, and that your Grace would
at, least be pleased ‘co re‘crieve his Majesty's benefaction, and by
the oharity of the chureh of England a means could be found ’ῡο
raise a 1000 pounds, iffi would add some tolerable endowmen‘cs to
these three poor livings, furnish bishop Barrow’s designed
library, and build some convenienb Academia lodgingS, and put
us out of condition of making· our miseries furbher troublesome.
I hope Ineed no excuse for my importunity (though a stranger)
which proceeds only from a sense of my duty, and on my knees
I beg your Graoe's benediction, and that you would ab least]
gran‘z your pardon, if nob encouragement to,
May it plea-se your Graee,
your Graee’s mosi] dutifuL mosi: humble
and obedient Servan‘o,
Wm. Sacheverell.
