Os Oommunication with αη Excommu-
nieate Person.

We inbibit all persons, and especially
chaplains from holding communication
with the publicly excommunicate, of
which offence if chaplains be found‘
charged they shall be subject to the
gravest punishment.

Of Rinyiny of Bells.

We order that the bell-ringers of
churches ring their belis when the
bishop comes to the church or pasees
by, which should they not do, let the

clergy be punished at the discretion of
of the bishop.

Of che 0ἰί and Chri-sm*

We ordain that every chaplain
receive once a year the holy 011 of
unction, and 011 for the sick, in vessels
most carefully cleansed and well closed
with wax. At the time of reception

receptionis singuli eorum quatuor de-

narios reddent. ‚each of them shall pay four pence.

'¹‘ The holy oils are of three kinds, used by the church in the administration of three
sacraments. First‚—The 011 of the Sick (Oleum Inferinorum), which serves to anoint
the sick in moral danger of death in the sacrament of Extrema Unction ; second,—-the 011
of Catechumens‚ used in anointing 111 the breast- and shoulders in Baptism, before the
sacrament is given ; third,—the Chi-ism, which is 011 of olives mixed with natural baisam.
This balsam was formerly always obtained from Gilead or Mecea, but that brought from
the East Indies or America is now sometimes used. Chrism is used 111 anointing the
head at baptism immediately after the sacrament is· administered by the ablution. It is
also used 111 1110 sacrament of confirmation, aud in consecrating bishops, churehes, altars,
chalices, 810. Τ110 first two kinds of holy oils consist of pure natural 011 of olives without
any mixture, but each has a peculiar episcopal benediction appropriated it. The holy
oils are blessed on Maunday Thursday. The new oils must be procured for each church
and priests The oils of the preceding year are decently burnt so soon as the new are
are received. The canons are sm'ct in forbidding the old to be made use of, when the

new can be procured.-Butler’8 Feasts and Fasts.
