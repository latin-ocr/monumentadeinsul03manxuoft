APPENDIX.

Of Archidiaconac visitamus, and the
Ornaments of tlte C'Icurch.

Moreover we ordain that the Arch-
deacon, after the example of the Apos-
tle, ssek not his own, but in his visita-
tion take order for the things of Jesus
Christ5 let him see that the canon of
the mass be kept in repairf* and that
priests have knowledge to set forth
rightly the words of the canon and the
baptisma] servicesl· and teaeh the laity
in what manner they ought to admin-
ister baptism in cases of urgent need, or
at least that they know how to do this
in the vulgar tongue. Moreover the
Archdeacon is to have all the ornaments
of the churehes and their vessels set
forth in writing, their vestments and
books, and should cause them to be
shown for his own inspeetion every year,
that [so] he may see what have been
added by the diligence of the parish-
ioners, or what have in the intervening
time been wasted by negligenee or cul-
pable act on the part of the vicars, or
any way diminished through their
wrongful aet, either by clerks or lay-
men.

Of the Celebration of Masses.
We do most strictly forbid any priest

to celebrate the solemn service of the
mass twice in one day, the days of

’³ss The missal, which is the hook containing “the canon of the mass,”—the principa]
prayers of the mass so called. The prayers called the canon of the mass are made up in a

separate book for the use of bishops at the altar.

But it does not appear that this was

ever done for the use of simple priests, For them the canon and the moveable prayers
were all united in the same volume, which is called the Missal, and which anciently was

sometimes called also the sacramentarium.—Sacearia apud illique, 5.

† T he book containing the forms of words and rubrics or directions for administration
of the sacrament of baptism. It appears that formerly this made a book by itself. At

present the forins and rubrio-s for the administration of all the sacraments, together with

other minor rites, aro collected in one volume called the Ritual.
