APPENDIX.

Also any chaplain to presume to bc
present at clandestine marriages, or

pro annulibenedictionealiquos contrahi on any alleged excuse to permit any

permittat, sed ea seeundum quod mo-
ris est tribus denuntiationibus in eccle-

persons to be conti-acted together other-
wise than by the blessing of the ring,

sia, publice et solemniter ad missae but he is to make the contract afore-

celebrationem per debita intervalla prae·
missis contractum faciat. Item quod
capellanus inter aliquos matrimonium
vel sponsalia facere non praesumat, nisi
tribus denuntiationibus prius factis in
ecclesia, quaerendo 'tam ubi vir manet,
quam mulier, nisi ambo in una paro-

chia fuerint. Et si qui postea contra

, matrimonium taliter contractum, ali-

quid alicui objicere voluerint, qui tem-
pore contractus, in cadem parochia
fuerint quod ad eorum notitiam veri-
simile sit tales denuntiationes deven-
isse, nullatenus audiantur.

De Juramenco eum Contraria.

Item statuimus, quod quilibet capel-
lanus jurare faciat, non solum ipsos con-
trahentes, verum etiam tres vel quatuor
aut quinque de senioribus et fide digni·
oribus utriusque parentelae contrahen-
tium quorum nomina redigentur in
scriptis, quod inter eosdem nesciunt
aliquod impedimentum, quo minus
possint legitime copulari. Similiter et
ab omnibus circumstantibus sub peri-
culo animarum suarum diligenter inqui-
rant. Et hoc ab omnibus capellanis
nostrae dioecesis in matrimoniali con-
tractu sub poena suspensionis triennalis

 

said after three public proclamatione
shall have been made according to
custom in the church‚ publicly and
solemnly at the performance of mass,
with proper intervals. Also any
parish clergyman to presumo to
solemnize marriage or espousals be-
tween any persons, without the bans
having been first three times called in
the church, asking as well where the
man resides as the woman, where they
do not both reside in the same parish.
And if any should afterwards desire to

make objection at all against any in

ἶ regard of a marriage thus contracted,

who at the time of that contract were
in the same parish so that it appear

ἵ probable that such announcements must

have come to their knowledge, let them
on no account receive a hearing.

Of Oatk with the contract.

Moreover we ordain that every chap-
lain should put to their oath, not only
the parties to the contract [of marriage]
themselves, but also three or four or
five of the elder and more worthy of
saith of the families of the contracting
persons on both sides, whose names
should be recorded in writing, that
they know of no impediment between
them why they should not be lawfully
joined together. Likewise also let
them diligently enquire of all the by-
standers upon the peril of their souls.
And this we do enjoin to be observed
