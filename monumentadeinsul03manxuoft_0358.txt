Stanley, Preston edition, printed by Sergent in 1793, the Editor observes that

Blundell, of Crosby, who prudently retired thither during the usurpat-ion,
whereby he preserved his person in peace and security and his estate from all
manner of depredatiom This gentleman, being a person of polite learning, em-
ployed his leisure hours in collecting the history and antiquities of the Isle of
Man, and by his manuscripts, which I have seen, gave posterity the clearest and
most correct account of itss’
